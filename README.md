# 📊 Progress Hub

A modern, lightweight progress-tracking web app built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. Progress Hub helps you plan weekly activities, track habits and streaks, manage daily and pending tasks, set goals, and keep a personal journal — all in a single, fast, and responsive interface.

**Status:** Frontend-ready (Vite + Tailwind). Data is currently stored in browser `localStorage`. For multi-device sync and user accounts, see the Full-Stack Roadmap below.

**Live preview:** Use `npm run dev` and open the URL printed by Vite (typically `http://localhost:5173`).

**Tech stack:**
- React 18
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS (PostCSS + Autoprefixer)
- Lucide React icons
- Progressive Web App (service worker + manifest)

**Repository:** https://github.com/NoorayFatima/Progress-Hub

git clone https://github.com/NoorayFatima/Progress-Hub.git
cd Progress-Hub

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port shown in your terminal).

## 🛠️ Development Commands

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build locally
npm run preview

# Start server (same as dev)
npm start
```

## 📦 Production Deployment

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy
vercel
```

### Deploy to Netlify
1. Build: `npm run build`
2. Drag the `dist/` folder to [Netlify Drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop)
   
Or connect your GitHub repo for automatic deployments.

### Deploy to Cloudflare Pages
1. Push to GitHub
2. Connect your repo to Cloudflare Pages
3. Set build command: `npm run build`
4. Set publish directory: `dist/`

```

## 🎨 Customization

### Colors
Edit `tailwind.config.js` to change the color scheme:

```javascript
theme: {
  extend: {
    colors: {
      primary: '#92487A',      // Purple
      secondary: '#E49BA6',    // Pink
    },
  },
}
```

### Activities
Modify the default weekly activities in `src/ProgressPlannerApp.jsx`:

```javascript
const [weeklyActivities, setWeeklyActivities] = useState([
  'SM', 'Namaz', 'Quran', 'Book', 'Typing', 'Course Work'
]);
```

## 💾 Data Storage

Currently, all data is stored in **browser localStorage**:
- Activities and weekly data
- Goals (weekly, monthly, yearly)
- Habits and streaks
- Tasks and pending tasks
- Journal entries

**Note:** Data persists locally on each device but is not synced across devices. To share data between devices, use the browser's sync/backup features or consider deploying the full-stack version (see below).

## 🔄 Full-Stack Version (Coming Soon)

To convert this to a full-stack application with user accounts, data persistence, and multi-device sync:

1. **Backend**: Node + Express + Postgres
2. **Authentication**: JWT tokens or email-based auth
3. **Database**: User accounts, encrypted data storage
4. **Deployment**: Docker + Render, Railway, or DigitalOcean

See `FULL_STACK_ROADMAP.md` for detailed steps.

## 🧪 Testing & Quality

```bash
# Build and test locally
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Open the preview URL in your browser and test all features.

## 📊 Performance Metrics

- **CSS Bundle**: 3.82 kB (gzip) — optimized Tailwind
- **JS Bundle**: 53.64 kB (gzip) — React + Lucide icons
- **Total**: ~57.5 kB (gzip)
- **Build Time**: ~3.4 seconds

## 🌐 Browser Support

- Chrome/Edge 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile)

## 🔐 Security Notes

- Currently frontend-only; no server-side security
- Passwords/sensitive data should NOT be stored in localStorage
- Use HTTPS when deploying
- For sensitive data, implement full-stack with proper backend authentication
